# DistSampleMeanApp
Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean App

The purpose of the app is to graphically show how the distribution of sample mean becomes approximately normal as more random samples are drawn from the original population. You can experiment with a variety of population distribution shapes and sample sizes.
